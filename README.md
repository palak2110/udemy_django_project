# udemy_django_project

This project was a part of my Udemy course on Django with Python3 by Nick Walter. It is a basic Word Count website with some major Front-End tweaks by me.
The project focuses on learning Django by knowing what each file or folder does such as manage.py, static etc.

Basic requirements:
Virtual Environment,
Pip3,
Python3,
Django (V. 2.0.2),
PostgreSQL (V. 10)
